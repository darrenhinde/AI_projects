These Crypto Meme Coins Are Going to Create Millionaires,mmAGACAjMJA,2721,1263,2024-03-02T17:28:56Z,CryptosRUs,706000,2413," Welcome back to CryptosRoss, I'm George. Or all George. So happy Saturday. Let me talk a little bit about Bitcoin. What we're seeing right now, there is one entity that is massively dumping once again. That's holding Bitcoin back. But you know what? Bitcoin coins are not being held back. They're exploding. So let me talk about these crypto meme coins. They're going to create millionaires. And there are a lot of them. So let's do this. Welcome, welcome, welcome guys. Happy Saturday. You can see Bitcoin is still going sideways. Let's start out with Bitcoin as always. What's going on with Bitcoin? Well, there's nothing to be sad about. Bitcoin is holding well above 61,000. We're going between this channel, the upper range, about 63,7 and the bottom range, about 60,800. We're going sideways. And that's because it's one entity. I think you guys already guessed. Great scale is massively dumping once again. And it does seem like this time around. It's because of Genesis. Genesis needs to sell 1.3 billion. We thought they were selling last week. That's not the case. They started selling this week. So they sold 500 million on Thursday, 500 million on Friday. And unfortunately the other ETFs could not compensate and could not eat it all up. But again, I've been saying this. You need an entity that's selling half a billion worth of Bitcoin per day just to move the needle a little bit for Bitcoin. What happens when the minus 500 stops? We saw briefly when when grayscale selling went below 100 million. That's when Bitcoin started exploding. And every single day right before market open, it does seem like Bitcoin wants to explode. And then grayscale selling kind of dampens the mood. But there's only so much they need to sell. And these guys are still accumulating hundreds of millions of Bitcoin per day. And I'm talking about all these other ETFs. So you know what? They're not the only ones that are salivating. You got Hong Kong that has 22 applicants for crypto exchanges. We talked about this in 2023. Hong Kong did not open. Yes, it's legal to trade crypto, but they don't have any exchanges yet. So that is about to happen. When you have 22, maybe not all 22, but when you have crypto exchanges open up in Hong Kong, let's go cause a bigger frenzy in terms of Bitcoin and crypto buying. And let's not forget Hong Kong also has a lot of spot ETF applicants too. That's all coming. I totally forgot about this as a amplifier for this year as a catalyst to drive things even higher. Okay, don't ignore this. Asia has a huge population with a ton of money that will all be flowing in. So that's also coming. And we have whales like this Mr. 100 who has accumulated $3.1 billion to the Bitcoin buying hundreds of Bitcoin per day since November of 2022. It makes you wonder if this possibly could be someone like Jeff Bezos. I mean, it doesn't seem like it's a bank. It doesn't seem like it's an institution because they're actually buying physical Bitcoin. It's probably just some very high net worth individual like Bezos, right? And they will continue to buy and buy and buy some more. So that's awesome. All right, last few things about Bitcoin. Metrics shows that a 1900% gain is about to come. There's a lot of good metrics. Here's an eye metric. Here's a chart, but normally speaking, you look at this head and shoulders. You're like, oh my God, Bitcoin's about to dump, right? But this is an inverse head and shoulders. So what does this mean? It's looking good. But then you got metrics like this, the stock to flow model that indicates that Bitcoin is what in a bull market. And that is absolutely fantastic, right? Not that you need a chart like this to tell you that. I could tell you that, but you know what? It makes it more official. So fantastic. Bull run. Yep, we're past the cumulacin stage. Here's another chart that shows us. Yeah, we are past. We are moving and we're moving towards a new high, which should be coming right around the corner. Let's not forget, we're above 61,000. We were at nearly 64,000. All time high for Bitcoin is only 69,000. It's not too far off, right? And the bigger Bitcoin gets, the more liquidity is in the space. And the more these other crypto, these all coins will go higher, right? And we're starting to see signs of that right now. Maybe a little bit too aggressive, but that leads me to these meme coins. Whether you like them or not, they drive a lot of people in and a lot of people are making a lot of money right now. But you got to be careful with memes, right? Obviously they can go up really quick and dump down. Especially the new ones, but all the old ones that we have from 2021 and even before, they're pumping every single one. I don't know if you guys noticed, dogecoin started moving. I thought dogecoin was left for dead unless Elon comes to save it. Nope, dogecoin woke up and you know what? Sheve also woke up. Sheve what up crazy yesterday. Crazy. I decided to take advantage of it. But you have another one like flokey that also blew up. So this was from yesterday. You could see like how crazy it got. Flokey went above 100% yesterday. Sheve what up 80-70% I was with one of my best friends who said he's been holding for three years and finally he broke into the green just for one day. That's how crazy it was. That pay what up 70% with one up about 50% at one point in time. Doge and Bonk both up 20-something percent, right? Even today, even though there's a little weakness, still we got a lot of movement. These, most of these are still very low in market cap. I mean with Bitcoin getting bigger and stronger and like I said, more liquidity, I mean these memes are going to blow up. Okay. Not advising anyone to like go all in I memes or throw large amounts at memes. But even having a little bit, just a little bit in your portfolio can make a big difference if they do blow up and we do know many of them do blow up. And this is a different cycle. Previous cycles we only had like one or two, maybe three blow up in a cycle. This cycle I believe we will have more than a handful, probably a dozen or so. That will all be blowing up because it's just a different environment now. Right. So I mentioned flokey shooting up, they have this new burn proposal that's going to burn 2% of their liquidity. So I guess that's good. Okay. But you have not only the old guard, sort of speak like that includes flokey and shebe and so forth. Right. But you have a new guard. Some that has been existing in space, you know, for a little bit like cock. Like who doesn't want some cock in you up 26% now up to $185 million. That's close to their previous all time. Right. They are skyrocketing right now the biggest meme on avalanche and you have another baby brother or yeah, I think baby brother within avalanche Kimbo that's also doing well. Now they're up 20% up to about 14 million. I didn't their previous high was 20 million or something like that. So these two relatively new on avalanche are both going higher. That's fantastic. You also have snack from Cardano that is starting to make moves again 126 million up 18%. Keep in mind, these are very small market caps, very small, only 100 something. They're not even at a billion like bonk or pepe or or or any of the others like flokey and shebe and so forth. So these guys have a lot of room to grow. Not a room to grow and I got to mention some new ones because they're they represented themselves in the IFC. A lot of you guys know Phil Russell. He's one of the main backers of suka and they have been going up a lot too. They went up 9% today but for the week they're up 129%. So got to give a shout out to suka. So got to give a shout out to Harry Potter Obamasonic 10 in you which is probably the most difficult crypto meme to remember. They are up 38% today up to 121 million. See as you can see every meme coin is up and more light who is also from this who was part of community flop and Armstrong. So got to give shout out to to his project and of course I give shout out to Kulo who also was founded by moon daddy and part of the IFC up 18 19% today although they were much higher. I really hope they go much much higher than that but it's harder to do on poly god. But anyways as you can see every single meme is blowing up right now and I didn't even show Pepe who also lost a lot of momentum and then started gaining back 1.7 billion in the last 7 days 223% and also bonk which I did not show yet even though they're down a little bit today. Last week 100% and since I am a D Gen and I like to play with leverage and memes. I did yesterday and I did pretty well. I caught shebe on its way up made 712% on that trade and then also caught with 500% trade so ain't too bad. I did close those out though by the way. Yeah and I didn't even bring up with let me bring up with for you guys. It is now above well above 1 billion in market cap. I don't know why there's a network here but it's up 19% today and up 271% in the last 7 days. Kind of crazy guys. Kind of crazy. So this tells me two things. Number one memes are back and full force. Okay. Whether you like it or not because you got a lot of retail players coming in and what did I say about Bitcoin? The bigger Bitcoin goes the less likely new retail investors will be stocking up a set. They rather stack up on what's moving like memes right. So that's number one. I do feel like yes this is definitely the start of the parabolic bull run because that's what you see a lot of memes start moving really quickly. Number two is though you got to be a little bit careful with these memes because they're all moving like at the same rate and they're all hot right now. That makes me think maybe some market makers or whales are driving this movement and maybe they will take some profits and you'll see them come down to reality soon but regardless and every bull cycle I think memes definitely serve a purpose and they would definitely go higher. Alright. That's pretty much it. Let's do some Q&A. I just can't get this camera. It's like it just it doesn't look right every single session. Here we go. That's two. Okay. Right there. That's where it should be. Alright. Let me scroll the comments. Let's see. The Kimbo community loves you. I appreciate that. Give a big shout out to Kimbo today. I still hold my Kimbo even though I don't talk about them a lot but I still hold them. I'm rooting for them. I'm rooting for Koch. I'm rooting for anything that has a good community and can do very well for his chain and they're both doing very well for for for a little bit. Crypto Chris no I'm not I'm not a secret ship oil though I made some good money on it. Andrew says he mule a lot of people keep shilling he mule and it's just it's because of the italics cat but it's like the worst sounding name ever and it is up 61% right now. 38 million relatively small. It's on salana no no surprise. So there's another one for people that may want to take a chance on something. Welsh on Bitcoin looks like a meme on Welsh Corgi coin. 100 million. There's so many memes out there. There's so many memes out there. Have you heard about Bob token on ETH? You know what I don't really pay attention to memes on ETH. Right now it's all about it's all about salana and then also you could say it's about Bitcoin. You have a lot of memes coming on Bitcoin too. Did you see on ex those snack blue lasers the community insane I did not see anything about I did not see anything about no lasers I still have my energy drinks that I did not bust out I did try one while I was in vacation last year and to be frank it was actually pretty good. I don't know how healthy it is but it did taste pretty good. Man CMC is like crapping out because there's too many. Any is meme injected being launched in dojo swap. What about ninja? Under ninja didn't catch on. Last the first meme on injective. It has been moving too but it's still relatively small 15 million. Can't calculate. There we go 100% in last seven days. Not too bad. All right I'm trying to screw I'm missing a lot of super chats here hold on sold my XRP for bonken with made all the money was down from and some embarrassing now that XRP was higher back and joy. Sometimes you just gotta make the move man and sometimes you're really happy that you did. Am I still bullish on saying so yes I've all right grits bit you I've seen you around you've been around for a while okay my opinion on chains don't change week after week. So I talked about them plenty please create George's cock with had. GC wh I know it would be it'll just be GC with GC with or G with. That's why. Is Corona Shane so relevant I guess so but I'm not a big fan of cronos Jeremy where do you do leverage trade I sold my she leash and boom three days ago that's why I pumped you're all welcome see that's what happens sometimes you know you get so fed up you're like I can't stand it anymore I and then you sell it and then that's when it pumps 80% is so I use money I'm XC's my main one I also use it on Bing X and tap it so there's a lot of them that I use. Are you aware the first AI creative turbo yeah that's been around for a while they lost a lot of momentum now they seem to be back I mean literally I could pull up any meme right now and they'll be up like 20 to 30%. I don't like the fact that it's like AI generated by whatever. If you're making money on it great can you look at Trump on soul. There are 290 million already they're up 11% 40% for the last time in days not as good as others. Do you think we'll come back down before to having people keep saying it I don't know who is people. Lazaro if you're listening to the bears like Garrett who still has a huge short position for some reason or I don't know anyone else I would say just stop listening to them. SP what do you think about base the Coinbase decks. I don't follow base that much but I have been hearing a lot about Errol Dome bases a huge layer to I don't pay attention on because there's no coins so kind of sucks I can't take advantage but I do hear a lot about Errol Dome and they are the biggest decks on base and it basically continues to get bigger than they will get bigger to. Filecoin that ACH Conflux I don't know Filecoin is considered a Chinese based project and that is not too they're based in Europe now they actually have they're like going all in on Europe. I mean they're all good you know ACH's and payments Conflux is a L1 that is a L1 Filecoins decentralized sword draw good projects. Simon says he didn't caps this chat is too much. Man we got so there's so many I gotta go these go through these super chats quicker is every time I scroll down there's like more. Well coolos are past 100 million Pablo I'm hoping so I'm hoping so I'm still supporting them I'm still reading for them I talked to moon daddy all the time I think what's holding coolo back right now is first around polygon second they don't have any sexes they need some exchange listings all these other ones are benefiting they're all on exchanges they need to get on some exchanges and then I think they'll blow up is there only a million market cap I mean that's so so low all these other ones are like 100 100 you know 100 200 100 a billion right coolo could get up there 10 million 20 million 50 million 100 million should be easy what do you think about my role with I mean what would be realistic all time high I mean there's there's no real like answer to that look at how high she went in 2021 right no one could have predicted that any of these could go up that much although I will say my role lost a lot a lot of momentum they should be close to a billion but they lost a lot of momentum because of the the rumors that the team was selling and so forth right I know they're up 25% but they were at 200 million at one point in time they're still way below their previous high so my role lost a lot of momentum but with it's just I don't I don't know where with is I had with up yeah with is just going nuts right now I'm pretty sure Coinbase listing is going to be announced soon for with have you heard of NFTs on Bitcoin a lot blew up this week and having a floor price of 30 but yeah I've heard of them but I'm not a big NFT guy so I don't really follow them Maxi doesn't let me leverage trading us they do you just have to get around that and I'm not gonna tell you how but it's pretty easy to figure out starting a dance starting what start watching last cycle I'm not missing single stream thank you been this year my portfolio is at 90k congratulations that's more than a Bitcoin about one and a half Bitcoin so thanks for advice over the years you're welcome and thanks for being a loyal watcher okay these these superchats are getting out of control now um eight all time highs not kept up when I be uh eventually eight will hit all time high but that's why I say eight of sometimes is quite boring but you know what hey they're up 8% you can't you can't complain about that okay they may be lagging a little bit but they have their days and today's one of them and even look chain link it's up 10% and she up 40% that's crazy they were much higher high mapper okay not that very interesting to me is Coinbase wallet safe yes the actual Coinbase wallet is a self-custody wallet yes uh Pepe climb 1.5 million uh I don't like memes that copy names from others so anything that has Pepe in it that's not Pepe itself I will not support any thoughts on num numbers protocol very small but curious 40 million I don't know anything about them um giving you the full picture we're open decentralized network designed to ensure a provenance for all types of creative work created by humans and AI all right something about storing and making sure that your pictures are not stolen some kind of verification using AI and blockchain something like that I don't put that in the maybe pile I don't have enough information on it decent amount of exchanges like Kucoin and Gates and and being Axe and Maxi I don't put that in the maybe pile comments that that might be a good one especially AI is getting so hot right now there's another one called g-Trump I don't know how to look at g-Trump um Johnny Fies says I took a promotional exam wish me luck um can you explain to do you con not great what fix uh it's not gonna fix ETH first of all good luck and second of all it's not gonna fix ETH it's meant to help the L2's like arbitrable optimism and polygon and everything else out there base from previous cycles we did bump dumb before having no we didn't no we didn't we have one last cycle because of the pandemic that's why if you look at the cycle before no we didn't we went down very very little uh sdn to what extent have you investigated suka ciphers employ messages uh zero I'm no idea what you're talking about I'm just supporting suka because Phil is a champion and he knocked out dreamer so I have to give him props and his project props Khan says snack the more it's traded the more will be burned dex is now at 1% fee that's interesting that's interesting I didn't know that well this next high pretty close they're pretty close they're all time high fifth nail is their community for those are us off you to my discord which is in my patreon it's growing there's a small community but it's growing big chat super chat like cock grande i think i know who that is that will jack like cock grande that's good that's good stuff you you miss my super movie and fa movie is it's it's okay movie the problem in multi bit is it does seem like it's trying to create a layer on top of bitcoin to replace brc 20 so that is going against the grain unless i'm thinking about different projects i'm pretty sure that's what it's about and that's going against the grain oh no no i'm sorry i'm thinking about something else um this is just a bridge a dex and a bridge that pairs your c20 to brc 20 which could be fine there's another bitcoin project that that was um that was what i was describing yeah that's fine i don't know anything about fa when anything is a lot of what visually come out of beta why what is stopping them from doing that they're just saying that just excuse for them to say well there's a network outage it's beta it's not beta it's it's they're probably gonna say beta forever that's really not relevant he meal people ask me about that already i hate that name okay i really hate it with a passion and i don't like memes on eave but right now yeah it's pumping jesus coin i wasn't jesus coin before and i got burned really badly and i i i rage quit yeah they're still down they're not really coming back up at all i mean they're still far off i i think it's i think it's best to go with something else he knew i don't know i just don't like eath based projects right now soulzilla really small i don't know a little bit too small for my liking but who knows maybe they blow up but seeing how they blew up here and they what all they they seem like they maybe dead geo i sent some h part to karate combat exchange for karate tokens and i want to send some h part to my wallet and i can't it's only giving me an option to send karate and i h bar yeah i think the the wallet only supports karate it doesn't support h bar did you send extra i mean yeah i don't know i i'm pretty sure the wallet only supports karate doesn't show the balance of h bar let me double check real quick let me go in my wallet center receive you can only receive karate and h bar and karate combat wallet okay so you can't receive h bar and then if you send oh okay the send only says karate but receive you can receive both yeah i'm glad to ask some about that that seems to be a mistake or basically why you to just get karate i said appreciate that i mean in meantime you just convert all to karate and send the karate out to another exchange and convert back to h bar i guess that works ascent thank you why did people not look at market cap grail was 500 usd now is 2600 still low they are arbitrage because people just don't care like in terms of market cap market cap is important like if cock was at like you know one trillion market cap i would say it's up size very limited but most people would say well no it could still do a hundred acts i'm like no it wouldn't be able to right so market cap is important i'll give you that but most of these are still relatively small so they can go much higher grail price not tracked or this one camelot the problem with a price this high is the fact that turns off a lot of people a lot of people only put a few hundred in that at time and they can't you know they look at 2600 they're not going to want to and this is because it's way too small the total supplies only 73,506 i get what they're doing but i'm telling you that's a big mistake to do it like that from a psychologist standpoint it's very very bad polo thank you thoughts on b pro i've ridden them off they got sold and the cio cio all those guys they're not even leading a project anymore so i'm no idea what they're doing fidgety beast important analysis here floguey dev discuss burning 2% supply while snack has 7% deflationary burns not in full effect yet we just burn 1.44% supply well thanks for that technical explanation if snack was on you know salana it'll probably be at a billion dollars already the reason why snack and that's good at all i'm not trying to dismiss that the reason why snack is not going any higher or is not higher is because they're on cardano but it's quite amazing to have a cardano project go up this much but that's quite simply the the reality of the situation that's on another man two super chats with no questions but you know what i still like snack i like the team i like what they're doing for cardano but cardano is just like a you know pretty serious and boring chain i'm quite surprised i'm really quite surprised that so much money went into sheave and pumped it up like 80% yesterday like i don't i don't know where that money came from that's enormous amount of money to pump it up by billions so it's good for all the sheepholders hopefully people that have been holding since 2021 did not give up on it new type you know what i even almost gave up on here they're just not moving they're they are really really really high even in my dece portfolio they're still down no more close to their previous high that's the reason why quinn development says i wish i bought more cock that's everyone's problem uh Leo render here renders in the ispace or they will be you're ready very big i don't know why it keeps saying network air cmc is just like crashing right now i sold 900 million sheep at christmas well that sucks but you know what it's not too late it's not too late 12 billion in market cap uh you know they were at like 40 billion they still need to do like a 4x 3x 3 and a half x so plenty of room but you could definitely see that that huge sudden spike up do you flash gourd do you recommend i transfer my tokens from my cold store to exchange or just do the exchange on a cold storage wall i don't know why would you transfer if you want to trade it then sure you transfer if you're not training it why would i why would you move it to the exchange i don't get that maga meme coin i don't like to get political people that are like trying to like pump trump coin or maga coin i stay away from that uh why are you magging with mag sounds a horrible name you know like names come into it like magda sounds horrible to me just like he meals sounds horrible to me i can't support like really horrible names maybe i'll be convinced but this just sounds bad why are there so many shitty dodgy uh there's 2.2 million cryptos so there there are a lot of bad projects all right guys call it a Saturday uh bitcoin still doing very well guys i know this is not my usual stream of saturday i want to highlight something else but bitcoin is doing just fine great scale unfortunately sold more but once they stop there's only so much i could sell once they stop bitcoin is going to form a new leg up and we are just right around the corner from being uh at all time high but in the meantime those of you guys are djens enjoy your meme coin pumps because right now like everything is pumping like every single meme and i covered so many of them they're all pumping so enjoy and there will be more pumping in the future um smash it a like subscribe to channel i'll see you guys monday tomorrow i will have my usual sunday walk maybe i share a little more info um and uh that's pretty much it have a good one guys take care bye bye","{

BITCOIN ETFs JUST FLIPPING FRIDAY! (EXPLOSIVE MOVE COMING AS MASSIVE COMPANY JUMPS IN!),JPUydDAIEG0,5416,597,2024-03-02T15:25:21Z,My Financial Friend,267000,495," How's it going everyone it's Sam we could be getting ready for an explosive move on Bitcoin and The ETFs also flipped yesterday. I want to explain what happened obviously. This has been a crazy week It seems like everything is just slowing down a little bit right now, which is good at least for Bitcoin now That's not really the case for some altcoins If we look here Bitcoin is in at 62,550 so looking pretty good right now Altcoins though are going nuts. I mean flow keys up 82% I saw that they had a massive burn that they approved We also have I don't know I Bitcoin cash is coming up here because she but in is up 29% there we go 46% for Bitcoin cash people thinking Bitcoin cash is just as good as Bitcoin. I don't know, but that's up a lot We also have she but in you up 45% Terra classic up 27% dog with hat you can see people are trying to get extra returns Right now like that they're moving from maybe not from Bitcoin, but they're moving into some more high risk altcoins Which honestly it's nice to see a little bit of liquidity going through the system We'll get into more of this in a minute though if you don't mind hit subscribe turn on the bell notification Underneath the video so you can see future videos just like this one There's also a link to Margex underneath the video on occasional on trade some of these cryptocurrencies for example You can trade Pepe you can trade sheba you can trade a bunch of cryptocurrencies on leverage with Margex underneath the video There's also a link to coin W where you can buy some of these if you don't want to trade them on leverage You can actually buy them on coin W with the link underneath the video you get some sign up bonuses on both these platforms Now I am doing a giveaway to actually let me pull this up We have a winner of the last giveaway That I mentioned in yesterday's video Joseph I sent you the cryptocurrency 150 USDT we're doing another giveaway here on my Twitter This is with Alvara Intenset all you have to do is follow like and repost this tweet follow them and then comment What date Alvara is actually listing on you in a swap and then give me your BEP USDT address So I can send a hundred and fifty dollars worth of USDT to as I said like people are going for bigger returns They're going to meme coins are going to higher risk cryptocurrencies. So yeah, something that has real value and actually has utility But is also new and shiny people are going to be attracted to that and this could be a huge huge TGE a huge listing so definitely check that out. I'll leave a link to this tweet underneath the video But GBTC had outflows yesterday that were massive again 492 million Wow, okay, so 492 million yesterday 600 million the day before so they're dumping absolutely dumping Bitcoin on the market now keep in mind if this is Genesis that selling because they did get approved to sell I think it's around two trillion dollar or two billion dollars worth of GBTC now They're giving back cryptocurrency in kind to their old clients or their current clients So they're selling this and then going and buying Bitcoin But there might be a little bit of a lag. This could be why we had kind of muted price action The other day on Bitcoin we didn't really see another big move up because honestly overall we had a net outflow The net outflow was about 140 million at least that's an estimate right now because Of GBTC selling so much you can see like we had these massive ground breaking days And that was because GBTC was muted to 22 million to 216 million then they started dumping 300 400 more million a day and it caused it caused the The inflows to go down a lot now. This is limited like if this is Genesis They don't have a ton left. Maybe they could do this for a few more days and that's it But if it's not Genesis We could see more outflows from GBTC now. Am I worried about this now? This is the majority of what's happening 500 million dollar buys a day that is the norm now or 400 million averaged out So we're gonna have more of that in the future. We still had inflows from FBTC from IBIT but they were just they were just smaller than what we had seen for GBTC So unfortunately, yeah, we didn't have a megapump because of the ETFs But that's still coming in my opinion. I think we're still going to have Some explosion soon. I guess you can see here. We have a triangle that's Closing pretty fast We might see some action tomorrow Maybe Monday either a big move up or big move down I would be more likely to think it's a big move up Some people don't think that there's gonna be some profit taking but keep in mind there are still a lot of entities that want to start buying Bitcoin Morgan Stanley files to buy Bitcoin ETFs with 12 funds according to SEC filings So they're getting their hands on Bitcoin. We know that BlackRock in general has been talking about huge allocations to their ETF and the Bitcoin with some of their private wealth clients We also know that there are other banks that are trying to get into Bitcoin overall Just it seems like everyone everyone and their brother and their cousin and their mom and their sister All of their financial advisors and banks want them to buy Bitcoin So eventually we will see more and more inflows I'm not too worried about this one day of outflows for the week You know, we hadn't seen this in a while But this is I suppose this is one of the larger outflow days. You can see 158 million here and 140 million there now It seems like I said liquidity is entering back into the system like some people are taking profits Maybe on some of the top cryptos that they're holding or just injecting new capital You don't get huge moves like this unless there's some pretty big buys 78% up 40% up 1000 sets which honestly I didn't know this was even a thing Maybe it just called sets and then yeah, it's priced by 1000 sets or something but this is a significant amount to 17% something that I've never heard of clay like there's just a lot going on right now So you want to be tuned in One thing that you could get access to is ather. There's something that I'm investing in only a few days left to get a piece of AEG through buy-bit official you can join now here subscription period is from February 29 to March 4 snapshot period is on March 4 so This could be pretty big too, you know, I talked about This alvara at the beginning of the video. I think ather's gonna be pretty awesome as well Now of course always do your due diligence. I'm not telling you to do anything but Yeah, you can definitely make some good money right now whether it's buying spot I still think bitcoins gonna run a lot Throughout the rest of the year in next year. I still think it's got a lot to run But yeah, I mean we're seeing some We're seeing some legs on Ethereum actually beating out Bitcoin on the last 30 days We're seeing some legs on some other all-tall though They're down against Bitcoin for the last 30 days But still like Salana back in that 125 130 range really bullish because that is price discovery Since last bull market like this is higher than we were in the last couple months or the last couple of years even And yeah, you can even see like Cardano up in that 75 cent range Doge going up another 10 percent. Let's look at my row My row I saw out the other day a lot. Let's see if it's still up Yeah, it's up 30 percent here today. I did a video on it just a few days ago like Yeah, this is the market that you don't want to you don't want to discount anything like just because something's I mean coin doesn't mean it's not gonna have a crazy day. I made a video on this Literally two days ago, and it's up 50 percent since then So let me know your thoughts on all this underneath the video definitely check out the links to To the tweet and then also to coin w and to margex Thank you for him subscribe and I'll see you in the next video You","{

Smart Money is buying Shiba Inu  🤩 Shib Crypto Token Analysis,1v2kmFIQlOk,2449,190,0,2024-03-02T07:04:10Z,58500,60," What the actual f*** is going on with Shiba Inu? I have no idea but I do know who has an idea. I know who bought before this rally and it's not a nobody. Here's the news, the masses get fed. They simply just follow crypto Twitter, they try to find out where the alpha is. This is not where you're getting it. Instead, it's way better to follow the important people like Roon Christensen, who totally got this rally. Roon Christensen, founder of Makadau, he swapped 100,000 USDC, interesting enough, not die, for 7.4 billion tokens. That was at 4.0 and 13. Now the price is at 4.0 and 20, so he conveniently bought over here just before the pump. He knows something we don't. And I believe that's the key to crypto success. The key to making money in crypto is to be better informed than others to know what the insiders know, to follow the insiders. You can try drawing random lines on charts and then argument your way around this, say, oh, we've been at a support. And yes, now Shiba relative to Ethereum might be expensive and maybe we turn around again. And you might even work with on-chain analytics and see how retail is selling while the whales are buying and thus conclude that maybe it might sense to buy. This tool by the way is also part of premium. Besides the alert that we've just seen, right, we're tracking all kinds of influencers. We've also got on-chain tools and we can see things like this. This is all nice and rosy, right? This is the number of wallets that hold $1,000 worth of the ship token. A small retail here on the left, medium-sized retail that's $10,000 and the whales that's over here on the right. $100,000 worth of the token. Roon Christensen joined that club just recently. That kind of data is useful, but especially for short term trading of altcoins, it's always best to look at what are the best people doing. Smart cheese here to copy the winners and trying to become the best informed in the market. That's a nice thing about the blockchain, right? It's all transparent. We can all track this. It's not like in traditional finance with stocks or it's not like with centralized exchanges. On the blockchain itself, we can see what the real heavyweights are doing, what the smart money is doing. We don't have to be smart ourselves. We can simply just copy the smart people. So here's the other news. Roon Christensen hasn't yet sold. So potentially this rally can last for a bit longer. Once he does trigger the sell button, I will make another video and publishes on YouTube. Of course, if you want to know about this earliest, then feel free to join premium. Link is down below the bitconstraid.com. Feel free to subscribe, I publish you as regularly. The like would be very much appreciated as well. It helps the channel grow.","{
